//! For production, we can use the code below.

//! In development, to avoid using up our quota for googleapi requests,

//! So, when you enter a word into the search bar, the word will alwys be displayed on the SearchPage

//! The json data in response.js is the result for the search word 'covid'

//! This code is for the live Api call.

//! but it will not pass through the api, and therefore

//! the json that will appear in the browser console will always be the covid results json

//! we are going to pull on the json data that's saved in response.js.
